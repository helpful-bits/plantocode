PlanToCode provides a human-in-the-loop workflow where team leads and stakeholders can review generated implementation plans, edit details, request modifications, and approve changes before they are executed by coding agents or developers. This ensures corporate governance and prevents regressions.",
        "q": "Can stakeholders review and approve plans before execution?"
      },
      "q10": {
        "a": "Absolutely. Plans open in a Monaco editor with syntax highlighting, diff-friendly formatting, and clipboard helpers. You can tweak the prompt, copy individual steps, and rerun generation without leaving the workspace.",

      },
      "q11": {
        "a": "Select two or more plans, write the merge guidance, and submit. The merged result is saved alongside the originals so you can compare drafts, keep notes, or rerun the merge with different instructions.",

        "a": "Token estimates, prompt previews, terminal health monitoring, and persistent sessions reduce rework. You decide when to run commands and which model to trust, while the app handles orchestration details.",

        "q": "How do Teams meetings become specifications?"
      },
      "q3": {
        "a": "Yes. Implementation plans break down changes on a file-by-file basis with exact repository paths corresponding to your project structure. This granular approach ensures you know exactly what will be modified before execution, providing complete visibility and control.",

        "q": "How is this different from chat-based coding agents?"
      },
      "q5": {
        "a": "Yes. The app assumes you already work in large repositories and are comfortable with terminals, dependency graphs, and architecture trade-offs. The software keeps context organized so you can apply your judgment faster.",
