# O1 Pro Flow Development Rules

## Language Models

- **Anthropic:** Exclusively use `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219` for all tasks requiring Anthropic models. Do not use other versions or models unless explicitly approved.
## Code Structure & Best Practices

- **Framework:** Next.js App Router (v15+) with React (v18+).
- **State Management:** Utilize React Context for global state where appropriate (e.g., `ProjectContext`, `FormatContext`). For local state, use `useState`.
- **Server Actions:** Place server actions in the `actions/` directory. Ensure they are clearly named and handle potential errors gracefully, returning an `ActionState` object.
- **Components:**
    - Reusable UI components go in `components/ui/`. Leverage shadcn/ui components where possible.
    - Page-specific or feature-specific components go under `app/_components/` or co-located with their routes if specific to a single page.
    - Follow React best practices (composition, hooks, forwardRef, displayName).
- **Utilities:** Place general utility functions in `lib/`. Domain-specific utilities can be in subdirectories (e.g., `lib/git-utils.ts`). Create helpers for repeated logic like API calls (`lib/anthropic.ts`).
- **Hooks:** Custom hooks for shared component logic go in `hooks/` (e.g., `hooks/useVoiceRecording.ts`).
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS via `globals.css` and `tailwind.config.ts`. Use `cn` utility for merging classes.
- **Prompts:** Define LLM prompts in the `prompts/` directory, separating them logically.
- **Types:** Define shared types in `types/`. Component-specific props can be defined within the component file.
- **Code Quality:**
    - Follow ESLint rules defined in `.eslintrc.json`.
    - Avoid code duplication; refactor common logic into hooks or utilities.
    - Ensure all code is production-ready: no placeholders, TODOs, or incomplete implementations.
    - Add comments only where necessary to explain complex logic.
- **Package Manager:** Use `pnpm` for dependency management.

## Workflow

- Ensure README.md is kept up-to-date with setup instructions and features.
