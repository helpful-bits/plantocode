# Global Project Rules

## Rule Selection
- Select the appropriate rule based on file context
  - For Swift files: Apply apple_development rules
  - For Rust files: Apply server_development rules
  - For SQL schema file: Apply database_migrations rules

## General Practices
- Always format code according to language-specific standards
- Add appropriate comments for complex logic
- Do not add unnecessary comments, but explain complex sections clearly.
- Use descriptive variable names
- Keep functions and methods small and focused
- Use proper error handling for the target language
- Handle edge cases explicitly

## Repository Organization
- Keep related code together in appropriate directories
- Follow the established project structure
- Put new files in the correct locations based on their purpose:
  - Apple-related code in the `/apple` directory
  - Server-related code in the `/server` directory, organized by domain/feature
  - Database migrations in `/server/migrations`

## Version Control
- Make atomic commits with clear commit messages
- Follow conventional commit message format when possible
- Reference issues in commit messages where applicable
