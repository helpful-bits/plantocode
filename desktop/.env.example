# URL of the Vibe Manager Server - Used as a fallback if Tauri can't provide the server URL
# The Tauri backend gets its SERVER_URL from desktop/src-tauri/.env or environment variables
VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Firebase Configuration for Vite frontend development mode
# The Tauri backend primarily uses the non-prefixed variables (FIREBASE_*) from desktop/src-tauri/.env,
# but will fall back to these VITE_* prefixed versions if the others are not available.
# This fallback behavior is implemented in desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/config_commands.rs.
