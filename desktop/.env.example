# URL of the Main Server - Used for API calls and authentication polling
# CRITICAL: This URL is used by the Tauri frontend for auth polling and must match your main backend server
# The Tauri backend gets its MAIN_SERVER_BASE_URL from desktop/src-tauri/.env or environment variables
# Example for local development: http://localhost:8080
# Example for production: https://your-production-server.com
VITE_MAIN_SERVER_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080

# --- Additional variables for development ---

# Tauri development server host
VITE_TAURI_DEV_HOST=localhost

# Tauri development server URL - Must match the devUrl in desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
VITE_TAURI_DEV_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:1420

# Rust logging configuration (matches setting in Tauri backend)
RUST_LOG=vibe_manager=debug

# Auth0 configuration is handled entirely by the Tauri backend
# No frontend environment variables needed for Auth0 authentication
