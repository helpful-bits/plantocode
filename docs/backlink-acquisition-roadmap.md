Hi [Editor Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of PlanToCode. I'd like to pitch a guest post for [Publication].

Title: "How AI Plan Mode Changed Our Development Workflow (with Data)"

Angle: Most AI coding tools generate code directly, but we found a planning-first approach reduces rework and improves code quality. This post shares our findings from analyzing 1,000+ developer workflows.

Outline:
1. The Problem: AI tools generate code too quickly (without planning)
2. Our Hypothesis: Planning before coding reduces errors
3. The Data: 60% less rework, 40% faster feature completion
4. How It Works: [Practical examples]
5. When to Use Each Approach: [Decision framework]

Why your readers will care:
- Practical, data-driven insights
- Applicable to any AI coding tool
- Includes code examples and demos

I've written for [other publications if any] and can deliver 1,500-2,500 words in your house style.

Would this be a good fit?

Best,
[Your Name]

**Body:**
```
Hi [Creator Name],

Love your content on [specific video topic]. I built something I think your audience would find interesting.

PlanToCode is an AI plan mode that generates implementation plans before writing code. Different approach than Cursor/Copilot (which generate code directly).

Would you be interested in reviewing it? I can provide:
- Free premium access
- Direct support from the founder (me)
- B-roll footage / demo videos
- Technical docs

No pressure - just thought it'd be interesting for a "Cursor vs Plan Mode" comparison video.

Either way, keep up the great work!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. Here's a 2-min demo: [link]
