## Hero Section Variants

### Current Version
**The Polite Context Guidance Centre for Somewhat Bewildered AI Agents**

You know the feeling. You're "vibe coding" with an AI agent - the ideas are flowing, it's magical... until it's not. The agent gets hopelessly lost in your codebase, starts ignoring instructions, hallucinates APIs, and writes code that feels like it belongs in a different project entirely.

That magic moment is gone. Now you're a babysitter writing novels of documentation just to keep the agent on track.

Here's the thing: your code IS the documentation. It evolves fast. Every refactor, every new feature - your codebase tells its own story. But AI has limited context. It wastes time searching through irrelevant files, missing the crucial ones, or worse - trying to understand everything at once.

Vibe Manager was born from hitting that wall. Hard. Agents don't need more rules - they need the right files, real context, and clear tasks. Simple as that.

### Example Refined Version
**The Polite Context Guidance Centre for Somewhat Bewildered AI Agents**

You've been there. You're "vibe coding" with an AI agent—the ideas flow, the results feel magical... until they don't. Suddenly, the agent is lost, ignoring your instructions, hallucinating APIs, and writing code that's clearly meant for another universe.

That magical moment? Vanished. Now you're a babysitter, chained to endless documentation, just trying to keep the AI on task.

But here's the truth: your code *is* your documentation. It evolves rapidly. Every refactor, every feature tells its own story, but AI's limited context leaves it stuck, wasting time chasing irrelevant details or missing the essentials entirely.

Vibe Manager was born from hitting that wall—hard. Your AI doesn't need more rules; it just needs the right files, clear tasks, and real context.

**Take Back Your Weekend.**

## How It Works Section Variants

### Current Technical Version

**1. The Briefing: Task Input & Refinement**
Just talk. Explain your complex logic or brainstorm out loud - GPT-4 transcribes it perfectly. Can't explain in words? Record your screen while demonstrating the issue. The AI refines everything into precise specifications.

**2. The Recon Mission: Finding What Matters**
The File Finder decomposes your task into logical areas, creates targeted search patterns, then AI assesses actual file content for relevance. Can expand to find critical dependencies when needed. Real-time intelligence finding what matters.

**3. Phoning a Friend: Deep Research**
Your LLM's knowledge is frozen in time. The Deep Research workflow fixes that by searching for current documentation to fill knowledge gaps. Get up-to-date answers for your specific implementation problems, integrated with your code's context.

**4. The Board Meeting: Council of LLMs**
Generate plans from multiple models. The architect AI performs deep synthesis, detecting blind spots and creating emergent solutions. Review with floating notes and edit plans directly before execution.

### Proposed Conversational Version

**1. The Briefing: Task Input & Refinement**
You know that moment when the bug is crystal clear in your head but explaining it feels impossible? Just talk it out. Ramble. Think out loud. GPT-4 catches every word. Still can't articulate it? Record your screen - show the chaos in action. The AI watches, understands, and transforms your scattered thoughts into a battle plan that actually makes sense.

**Alternative Version:**
Remember that moment when you're trying to explain a bug but words fail you? Just talk it out - messy thoughts and all.

**2. The Recon Mission: Finding What Matters**
It's 3 AM. You're hunting through file after file, knowing that one crucial function exists somewhere in this maze. The File Finder doesn't just search - it thinks. It maps your codebase like a detective, following the trail from entry points to dependencies, surfacing exactly what you need. No more diving into rabbit holes. No more missing the obvious.

**Alternative Version:**
You've been there - scrolling through hundreds of files, knowing the one you need is somewhere but where? The File Finder gets it. It thinks like you do, breaking down your task and hunting down exactly what matters.

**3. Phoning a Friend: Deep Research**
Your LLM's knowledge is frozen in time. Meanwhile, that library you're using? Critical vulnerabilities patched, game-changing features shipped, and yes - they broke half the APIs along the way. The Deep Research workflow keeps up with this chaos, fetching fresh documentation from a world that refuses to stand still.

**Alternative Version 1:**
Your LLM learned everything months ago, but that React hook you need? It shipped last week. Those API breaking changes? Yesterday. The Deep Research workflow bridges this gap, pulling in the latest docs while libraries evolve at breakneck speed.

**Alternative Version 2:**
LLMs have knowledge cutoffs measured in months. Your dependencies? They update daily. The Deep Research workflow keeps pace with the relentless npm update notifications, fetching current docs for the actual versions you're using.

**Alternative Version 3:**
LLMs learn once and remember forever. But your dependencies? They're living, breathing chaos - security patches breaking things, shiny new features arriving with completely reimagined APIs. The Deep Research workflow navigates this moving target, grabbing today's docs for yesterday's breaking changes.

**4. The Board Meeting: Council of LLMs**
One model says refactor everything. Another suggests a quick patch. A third has a completely different approach. Sound familiar? The Council brings together the best minds - Gemini's reasoning, Claude's nuance, GPT's breadth - then the architect AI steps in. It finds the wisdom between extremes, merges the genius from each perspective, and delivers one coherent plan. No more analysis paralysis. Just clarity.

### Example Refined Version

**1. The Briefing: Task Input & Refinement**
You know the struggle—an idea is crystal clear until you try to explain it. Just speak freely; GPT-4 accurately transcribes your words exactly as spoken. If you're typing and need clarity, select your text for instant improvement and correction. Still stuck? Record your screen, with optional audio—Gemini deeply analyzes the video to extract detailed context, including error messages, code snippets, UI interactions, and debug information, empowering your AI with complete clarity.

**2. The Recon Mission: Finding What Matters**
No more midnight file hunts. File Finder acts as your personal detective, dissecting your task into logical chunks, identifying essential files, and quickly uncovering dependencies. Zero rabbit holes, maximum productivity.

**3. Phoning a Friend: Deep Research**
Your LLM's knowledge has strict cut-off points, leaving it unaware of recent critical updates—security patches, newly shipped features, and breaking API changes. The Deep Research workflow resolves this by precisely identifying critical knowledge gaps and fetching authoritative, up-to-date documentation, ensuring accurate, verified context for your specific implementation needs.

**4. The Board Meeting: Council of LLMs**
Multiple implementation plans, whether from different models or repeated runs of the same model, often result in varied insights—each plan capturing aspects others might overlook. The Council of LLMs systematically synthesizes these valuable elements, carefully resolves conflicts, ensures alignment with your existing architecture, and creates a comprehensive, optimized implementation strategy. The outcome? Clear, thorough, and actionable next steps.

## Key Style Elements to Maintain

### Conversational & Empathetic
- Start with relatable pain points ("You know the feeling...", "You've been there...")
- Use vivid, emotional language that developers connect with
- Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones

### Story-Driven
- Frame features as solutions to specific frustrations
- Use mini-narratives that follow a problem-to-solution arc
- Include specific scenarios developers face (3 AM debugging, etc.)

### Authentic & Direct
- Avoid corporate speak or marketing fluff
- Use contractions and informal language where appropriate
- Be honest about costs and limitations

### Visual & Metaphorical
- Use metaphors consistently (detective, babysitter, time capsule, etc.)
- Paint vivid pictures of developer experiences
- Make technical concepts tangible and relatable

### Focus on Outcomes
- Emphasize how it feels to use the tool, not just what it does
- Highlight the transformation from frustration to productivity
- Always connect features back to developer pain points
