# Vibe Manager: The Middle Manager Your AI Coding Assistant Desperately Needs

You know the feeling. You're "vibe coding" with an AI agent—the ideas are flowing, and it's magical... until it's not. The agent gets hopelessly lost in your large codebase, starts ignoring instructions, hallucinates APIs, and writes code that feels like it belongs in a different project entirely.

That magic moment is gone. Now you're a babysitter.

You find yourself writing novels of documentation just to keep the agent on track. You create endless rule lists, turning your creative flow into a tedious game of "Simon Says." This isn't what AI-assisted development was supposed to be.

I built Vibe Manager because I hit that wall. Hard. My own project, this very app, was a mess of bugs and instability because the agents I used couldn't see the big picture. I realized agents don't need more rules; they need a competent middle manager. They need a higher entity to find the *exact* files, understand the *real* context, and give them a crystal-clear, specific task.

Vibe Manager is that middle manager. You're the CEO with the vision. Vibe Manager does the logistical heavy lifting. The LLMs are your agents in the field, executing perfectly curated plans.

## How It Works: Giving Your AI a Brain (and a Map)

Vibe Manager doesn't just throw files at an LLM. It's a multi-stage workflow engine that thinks like a senior developer. It's the app I built to fix my own development workflow, and it's how this very app and website were created.

#### Step 1: The Briefing (Task Input &amp; Refinement)
A great plan starts with a clear goal. We make it effortless to capture yours.
*   **Voice Dictation:** Just talk. Capture your stream of consciousness, technical thoughts, and complex logic faster than you can type.
*   **AI-Powered Text Improvement:** Select any text in the app—your task, a system prompt, even a plan you're editing—and our AI will improve its clarity and quality on the spot.
*   **Task Refinement Analysis:** Our AI analyzes your codebase to clarify ambiguous requirements, identify exact boundaries, and specify which components are actually involved—turning vague ideas into precise specifications.

#### Step 2: The Recon Mission (Finding What Matters)
This is where Vibe Manager earns its keep. Forget vector databases that go stale. We rely on something far superior: the raw intelligence of modern LLMs. It's faster, more accurate, and doesn't require you to constantly re-index your project. Our **File Finder Workflow** acts like a senior dev dropped into your project, using a 4-stage process (Regex Filtering → AI Content Assessment → Extended Path Finding → Path Correction) to pinpoint only the essential files.

#### Step 3: Phoning a Friend (Deep Research Workflow)
Your codebase doesn't exist in a vacuum, but your LLM's knowledge is frozen in time. We fix that. I faced this exact problem needing to integrate FeatureBase for user feedback. I told Vibe Manager: *"I learned on X that FeatureBase is cool... how do I integrate it into our system? Which code parts need to be adjusted?"* It understood my code, figured out the right questions to ask the internet, and came back with a perfect, up-to-date implementation plan. 

We don't just search the web—we consult only **official documentation** from authoritative sources. No outdated Stack Overflow answers. No random blog posts. Just current, verified information straight from the source. You can run the full research workflow or choose **"Just Prompts"** to generate the search queries for your own review—a cheaper, faster first step.

#### Step 4: The Board Meeting (The Council of LLMs)
One model's genius is another's blind spot. We leverage a "Council of LLMs" for a superior strategy.
*   **Multi-Model, Multi-Run Generation:** We generate plans from multiple top-tier models (Gemini, Claude, Grok, etc.) simultaneously. Running the *same* model multiple times is also incredibly valuable—it often uncovers different bugs and details in each pass.
*   **Intelligent Merging &amp; Ergonomic Review:** Our architect AI doesn't just combine plans—it performs **deep synthesis intelligence**: detecting blind spots no individual plan caught, creating emergent solutions that transcend individual limitations, and ensuring architectural coherence throughout. As you review, jot down your thoughts in a **floating notes window**. You can even edit the plans directly. The merge AI will incorporate your feedback.
*   **Execute with Confidence:** Take the final, superior plan to your agent of choice (we love Claude Code's sub-agents). You're the CEO, setting the vision. We handle the management.

## You Are in Control. Always.

This isn't a black box. Your code and your data are yours. Period.

*   **Your Code Stays Local:** The app runs on your desktop. Your code never leaves your machine except when you a-ok it to be sent directly to the LLM providers. It lives in your Git repo, where it belongs.
*   **Your Data Stays Local:** All sessions, task descriptions, and file selections are stored in a local SQLite database on your computer. No cloud storage. No remote backups. Your work history never leaves your machine.
*   **Full Customization:** You are the CEO. You can override *any* system prompt for any task. You can even customize the text for the "Copy Button" instructions to perfectly match your workflow.
*   **Truly Parallel Work:** While one implementation plan is generating, switch to another session and kick off a different workflow. Vibe Manager runs jobs in the background so you're never blocked.

## The Intelligence Under the Hood

*   **Pattern Recognition:** Decomposes your task into logical functionality areas, creating targeted search patterns for each aspect.
*   **Ambiguity Resolution:** Analyzes your actual code to clarify vague requirements and identify exact boundaries.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** When AI models disagree, applies principle-based resolution—choosing approaches that follow SOLID principles and integrate cleanly.
*   **Emergent Solutions:** The merge process doesn't just combine—it synthesizes, creating solutions better than any individual plan could achieve.
*   **Authority First:** Web research uses only official documentation. No guesswork, no outdated tutorials—just facts from the source.

## FAQ: "Alright, but apart from the files, what has Vibe Manager ever done for us?"

*   **Q:** "So it just finds the right files?"
*   **A:** "Well, yes, it finds the *right* set of files. But also..."
*   **Q:** "What else?"
*   **A:** "It integrates up-to-the-minute web documentation with your codebase. And it generates implementation plans from a council of AI models, then merges them into a single, bulletproof strategy."
*   **Q:** "Okay, but apart from finding files, doing web research, and creating merged multi-model plans...?"
*   **A:** "It keeps your code completely private on your local machine. And lets you customize every single system prompt and copy-paste instruction. And it has voice dictation. And it runs all its workflows in parallel so you can work on multiple tasks at once."
*   **Q:** "Alright, I'll grant you that the file finding, web research, multi-model plans, privacy, custom prompts, voice dictation, and parallel workflows are nice. But apart from ALL THAT, what has Vibe Manager ever done for us?"
*   **A:** "It gave you your weekend back."
*   **Q:** "But how do I know the web research is accurate?"
*   **A:** "We only use official documentation from authoritative sources. If it's not from the vendor's official docs, GitHub repo, or developer portal, we don't use it. Period."
