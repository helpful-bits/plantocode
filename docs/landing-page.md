# Vibe Manager: The Middle Manager Your AI Coding Assistant Desperately Needs

You know the feeling. You're "vibe coding" with an AI agent, the ideas are flowing, and it's magical... until it's not. The agent gets hopelessly lost in your large codebase, starts ignoring instructions, hallucinates APIs, and writes code that feels like it belongs in a different project entirely.

That magic moment is gone. Now you're a babysitter.

You find yourself writing novels of documentation just to keep the agent on track. You create endless rule lists, turning your creative flow into a tedious game of "Simon Says." This isn't what AI-assisted development was supposed to be.

I built Vibe Manager because I hit that wall. Hard. My own project was a mess of bugs and instability because the agents I used couldn't see the big picture. I realized agents don't need more rules; they need a competent middle manager. They need someone to find the *exact* files, understand the *real* context, and give them a crystal-clear, specific task.

Vibe Manager is that middle manager. You're the CEO with the vision. Vibe Manager does the logistical heavy lifting. The LLMs are your agents in the field, executing perfectly curated plans.

## How It Works: Giving Your AI a Brain (and a Map)

Vibe Manager doesn't just throw files at an LLM. It's a multi-stage workflow engine that thinks like a senior developer. It's the app I built to fix my own development workflow, and it's how this very app and website were created.

#### Step 1: The Briefing (Task Input & Refinement)
A great plan starts with a clear goal. We make it effortless to capture yours.
*   **Voice Dictation:** Just talk. Capture your stream of consciousness, technical thoughts, and complex logic faster than you can type.
*   **AI-Powered Text Improvement:** Our AI refines your raw thoughts into a polished, clear task description, preserving all your formatting and intent while removing the fluff.

#### Step 2: The Recon Mission (Finding What Matters)
This is where Vibe Manager earns its keep. Forget vector databases. We rely on something far superior: the raw intelligence of modern LLMs. It's faster, more accurate, and doesn't require you to constantly re-index your project. Our **File Finder Workflow** acts like a senior dev dropped into your project, using a 4-stage process (Regex Filtering → AI Content Assessment → Extended Path Finding → Path Correction) to find only the essential files.

#### Step 3: Phoning a Friend (Deep Research Workflow)
Your codebase doesn't exist in a vacuum, but your LLM's knowledge is frozen in time. We fix that. I faced this exact problem needing to integrate FeatureBase for user feedback. I told Vibe Manager: *"Integrate FeatureBase for user feedback, put it in a new tab, and make it work with my existing auth."* It understood my code, figured out the right questions to ask the internet, and came back with a perfect, up-to-date implementation plan. It just works.

#### Step 4: The Board Meeting (Multi-Model Plan Synthesis)
One model's genius is another's blind spot.
*   **Multi-Model Generation:** We generate implementation plans from multiple top-tier models (Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, Grok, etc.) simultaneously.
*   **Intelligent Merging:** Then, our architect AI merges them, combining the best ideas, filling in the gaps, and creating a single, superior plan. You take this to your agent of choice (we love Claude Code's sub-agents). You're the CEO, setting the vision. We handle the management.

## You Are in Control. Always.

This isn't a black box. Your code and your data are yours. Period.

*   **Your Code Stays Local:** The app runs on your desktop. Your code never leaves your machine except when you a-ok it to be sent directly to the LLM providers. It lives in your Git repo, where it belongs.
*   **Your Data Stays Local:** All sessions, task descriptions, and file selections are stored in a local SQLite database on your computer. We don't use cloud-based vector databases.
*   **Full Customization:** You are the CEO. You can override *any* system prompt for any task to fit your project's specific needs. You can even customize the text for the "Copy Button" instructions in the implementation plans.

## FAQ: "Alright, but apart from the files, what has Vibe Manager ever done for us?"

*   **Q:** "So it just finds files?"
*   **A:** "Well, yes, it finds the *perfect* set of files. But also..."
*   **Q:** "What else?"
*   **A:** "It integrates up-to-the-minute web documentation with your codebase. And it generates implementation plans from multiple AI models, then merges them into a single, bulletproof strategy."
*   **Q:** "Okay, but apart from finding files, doing web research, and creating merged multi-model plans...?"
*   **A:** "It keeps your code completely private on your local machine. And lets you customize every single prompt. And it has voice dictation so you can talk instead of type. And it runs all its workflows in parallel so you never have to wait."
*   **Q:** "Alright, I'll grant you that the file finding, web research, multi-model plans, privacy, custom prompts, voice dictation, and parallel workflows are nice. But apart from ALL THAT, what has Vibe Manager ever done for us?"
*   **A:** "It gave you your weekend back."

## Why This Isn't Just Another AI Wrapper

1.  **Three-Pronged Attack:** Code Analysis (File Finder) + Web Intelligence (Deep Research) + Architectural Synthesis (Multi-Model Merging). It's a complete strategy.
2.  **Actually Efficient:** We don't brute-force your wallet. Smart, cheap filtering runs before the expensive AI gets involved.
3.  **No-Nonsense Cost Tracking:** See costs in real-time. No magic numbers.
4.  **You're in Control:** Customize everything. Your project, your rules.
5.  **Your Code Stays Yours:** Local-first. Privacy-first. Period.
6.  **AI Committee, Not a Lone Wolf:** We merge plans from multiple models because a team of experts is better than one.
7.  **Never Start from Scratch:** Persistent context means you can pick up right where you left off, instantly.
8.  **Truly Parallel:** Built for the impatient developer. Run everything at once. Never wait.

## Getting Started

1.  **Download and Install:** Get the app for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).
2.  **Authenticate:** Log in with Google, GitHub, Microsoft, or Apple.
3.  **Select Your Project:** Point it to your local Git repository.
4.  **Describe Your Task:** Use your voice or keyboard. Let the AI refine it.
5.  **Curate Context:** Run the File Finder and/or Deep Research workflows.
6.  **Generate & Merge Plans:** Create plans from your favorite models and merge them.
7.  **Execute:** Copy the final plan into your AI agent of choice and watch it build correctly the first time.
