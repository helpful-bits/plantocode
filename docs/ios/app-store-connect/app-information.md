* Quick actions for daily planning and sprint review

**How it works**

1. Install PlanToCode on your Mac.
2. Pair the iOS app with your Mac over LAN or secure remote connection.
3. Control your projects from anywhere. No cloud copy of your files—your Mac stays the source of truth.

**Privacy & security**

* No ad tracking; no third-party ads
* Only minimal account info (email/user ID) is used to operate your account
* Content on your Mac (files/terminal output) stays on your devices

## Screenshot Guidance

Order screenshots to **show the app doing real things** (Apple dislikes login-only shots):

1. Task list with controls
2. File toggles view
3. Planning/sprint board
4. Dictation / note edit
5. Terminal output (text-only)
6. Settings → Connection panel

Apple wants screenshots that depict the app in use, not just splash/login screens.
