## STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions (Next 2 Days):

1. **Create 2 solution pages (highest conversion potential)**:
   - `/solutions/prevent-duplicate-files` - targets 140/mo, difficulty 8
   - `/solutions/ai-wrong-paths` - targets 90/mo, difficulty 5

2. **Create 1 page**:
   - `/cursor-alternative` - targets 880/mo, difficulty 14

### Quick Wins (Days 3-7):

3. **Create 2 blog posts**:
   - "What is AI Code Planning?" - targets 480/mo, difficulty 11
   - "AI Code Planning Best Practices" - targets 90/mo, difficulty 8

4. **Enhance homepage**:
   - Add internal links to new solution pages
   - Update metadata with problem-specific keywords

### High-Volume Content (Days 8-14):

5. **Create 2 more blogs**:
   - "AI Pair Programming vs AI Planning" - targets 1,200/mo, difficulty 22
   - "Legacy Code Refactoring with AI" - targets 540/mo, difficulty 18

6. **Create interactive matrix**:
   - "AI Coding Tools Comparison" - targets 920/mo, difficulty 28

---

## CONCLUSION

**Current State**: 30% of planned high-priority content is published
**Content Gap**: 14 pieces missing (6 blog posts, 5 solution pages, 3 special projects)
**Days Behind Schedule**: 5-8 days behind Week 2-3 targets

**Most Critical Missing**:
- Problem-specific solution pages (duplicate files, wrong paths)
- Problem-aware blog content (prevent production breaks)
- High-volume keyword blog posts (AI pair programming, legacy code)

**Opportunity**: 8 quick-win keywords (difficulty <12) with NO content yet can be captured with 3-4 solution pages
